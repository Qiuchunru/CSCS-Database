# 1. Project Description

The **Country Soccer Club System (CSCS)** is a relational database system developed for managing the operations of a nonprofit soccer club.

The system stores and manages information related to:

- Club locations
- Personnel and employment history
- Club members
- Family members and guardians
- Member hobbies
- Teams
- Membership payments
- FIFA game participation


The database was designed using the Entity-Relationship (E/R) model, transformed into a relational schema, and implemented using MySQL 8.0.

This project demonstrates important database concepts including:

- ER modeling
- Relational schema design
- Primary keys
- Foreign keys
- Data integrity constraints
- SQL queries
- Database implementation


---

# 2. Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are:

- Design a complete database model for a soccer club.
- Convert the ER model into relational tables.
- Implement the database using MySQL.
- Maintain consistency using database constraints.
- Insert realistic sample data.
- Develop SQL queries to answer business requirements.


---

# 3. Technologies Used


| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| MySQL 8.0 | Database implementation |
| MySQL Workbench | SQL execution and testing |
| Visual Studio Code | SQL and documentation editing |
| Draw.io | ER diagram generation |
| Markdown | Documentation |


---

# 4. Repository Structure


The repository contains the following files:


## ER Diagram


The database conceptual design was created using Draw.io.

The ER diagram represents:

- Entities
- Attributes
- Primary keys
- Foreign keys
- Relationship constraints


![CSCS ER Diagram](ER_Diagram/Conceptual%20ER%20Diagram.png)


Location:

- Conceptual ER Diagram.drawio
- Conceptual ER Diagram.png


The Draw.io file is the source file used to generate the ER diagram image.


## Relational Schema

Location:

- Relational_Schema.md


This document describes the mapping from the ER model to relational tables.


## SQL Implementation

Location:

- SQL/


The SQL folder contains database creation scripts, table definitions, data insertion scripts, and queries.


Main database tables:

- Locations.sql
- Personnel.sql
- ClubMembers.sql
- FamilyMembers.sql
- FamilyRelationship.sql
- Family_Location_History.sql
- Member_Location_History.sql
- Personnel_Assignment.sql
- Hobbies.sql
- Member_Hobby.sql
- Payments.sql
- Teams.sql
- Team_Members.sql
- FIFA_Games.sql
- Game_Participation.sql


SQL queries are located in:

- SQL/queries/

# 6. Database Setup


## Step 1: Create Database


Open MySQL Workbench.


Execute:

CREATE DATABASE CSCS;

USE CSCS;


or run:


SQL/create_database.sql


---

## Step 2: Create Tables


Execute all SQL files inside:


SQL/


Each SQL file creates one database relation.


---

## Step 3: Insert Data


Insert data after creating all tables.


Recommended order:


1. Locations

2. Personnel

3. ClubMembers

4. FamilyMembers

5. Hobbies

6. Personnel_Assignment

7. Member_Location_History

8. Family_Location_History

9. FamilyRelationship

10. Teams

11. Team_Members

12. Member_Hobby

13. Payments

14. FIFA_Games

15. Game_Participation

# 7. SQL Queries


The project contains eight required SQL queries.


Location:

SQL/queries/


The implemented queries include:


## Query 1

Get complete details for every location.

Includes:

- Location information
- Personnel information
- Number of members
- FIFA participation statistics


## Query 2

Retrieve major members who played FIFA games.


Includes:

- Member information
- Age
- Location
- Number of games played


## Query 3

Retrieve members with at least four hobbies.


## Query 4

Retrieve major members who never played FIFA games.

## Unique Constraints

Implemented for:

- SSN
- Medicare Number


## Historical Data Management

The database maintains:

- Personnel working history
- Member location history
- Family relationship history


---

# 9. Testing


The database was tested using MySQL Workbench.


Example:


SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ClubMembers;


Each table was verified to contain valid sample data.


All eight required SQL queries were executed successfully.
